## Summary


This was the first meeting held by our team. We decided on tooling for this project, both for team management (Trello Kanban boards, Google Docs and MS Teams for idea sharing and keeping in touch) as well as for the design and technical sides of the project (draw-io / VisualParadigm for UML Modelling, Figma for UI Scaffolding, Android Studio + Dart + Flutter + Material Design for the implementation).

 A rough roadmap for the project was created. The brief for the coursework was discussed and we also did some brainstorming. The next week will focus on UML design and UI scaffolding, the following week on implementation and the week after on testing and validation, with one week until the deadline to spare for potential delays. 
 
 Each team member was assigned tasks on the Trello Kanban board. The team came to the decision to work on the assigned tasks and meet again in one weeks time, on the 3rd of March.
